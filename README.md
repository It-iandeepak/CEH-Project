# CEH-Project
This project involves performing in-depth network penetration testing using real-world exploits to assess and enhance the security of a simulated enterprise network. Aligned with the objectives of the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification, the project aims to replicate the approach of malicious attackers in order to uncover vulnerability.
